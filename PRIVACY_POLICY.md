# Privacy Policy for Check Me In

**Last updated: January 18, 2026**

## Overview

Check Me In ("the App") is a personal journaling application that helps you track your worries, gratitude, and mood. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how your data is handled.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

The App stores only the data you explicitly enter:

- **Worry entries**: Text you type in the Worry Box
- **Gratitude entries**: Text you type in the Gratitude Box
- **Mood entries**: Mood selections you make

Each entry includes a timestamp of when it was created.

### What We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Any data from other apps

## Data Storage

All your data is stored exclusively in your personal iCloud account using Apple's iCloud Documents feature. This means:

- **Your data stays on your devices and in your iCloud account**
- We do not have access to your data
- We do not operate any servers that store your data
- We cannot read, access, or share your journal entries

Your data syncs automatically between your devices signed into the same iCloud account.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your data with anyone. Since all data is stored in your personal iCloud account, only you have access to it.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Retention

Your data remains in your iCloud account until you delete it. You can delete the App at any time, and you can manage your iCloud storage through your device settings.

## Security

Your data is protected by Apple's iCloud security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest. We recommend using a strong Apple ID password and enabling two-factor authentication.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The App is a general-purpose journaling tool with no age-restricted content.
